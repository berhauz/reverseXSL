1. UNIX/LINUX USE:

Under UNIX/LINUX, the software is executed with the help of a JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
of at least version 1.4, that is the only prerequisite.

The directory containing the present file features 3 sample messages
in well-known non-XML brands:
	Sample1_MT101.txt 		is a Request for money transfer in SWIFT format.
							Once confined into the Inter-bank arena, such messages
							are also used between corporate customers and banks.
	Sample2_TypeB_FWB.txt	Is an air-freight Waybill message, in other words an 
							invoice for the carriage of goods as standardised by IATA
	Sample3_VATdeclare.csv.txt	is a CSV file exported from an MS-Excel sheet. 
							The original MS-Excel sheet and an associated batch
							program invoked by a Macro can be extracted from the 
							/samples directory inside the .jar itself (you can 
							open a jar file with a zip extractor).
							
There are three similar shell scripts 'TransformSample1|2|3.sh' which you
shall invoke from a shell command like:
	sh TransformSample1.sh

Just try it now!

These scripts are purely illustrative. A fourth script simply named 'Transform.sh'
takes the sample file name as argument, alike in:
	sh Transform.sh Sample2_TypeB_FWB.txt

All these scripts contain a single line of interest! the call to the reverseXSL
Transformer. Java provides many ways to invoke this same program:
	
 a) explicit classpath with main class call:
	java -cp ReverseXSL.jar  com.reverseXSL.Transform  mySampleDataFile
 b) jar execution (the main class call is defined inside the jar manifest)
	java -jar ReverseXSL.jar  mySampleDataFile
 c) implicit classpath with main class call:
	CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:./ReverseXSL.jar"
	export CLASSPATH
	java  com.reverseXSL.Transform  mySampleDataFile
	
It is quite important to understand the following:
 * The main class com.reverseXSL.Transform is only a wrapper around the reverseXSL
   Transformer API. This API is the true interface of the software. The command line
   programs, and the scripts by the same token, are purely demonstrative.
 * Command line programs can also be customised (the source code available in the jar 
   file). Command line wrappers are useful during development and testing.
 * The reverseXSL Transformer only needs the input file as argument. It decides
   dynamically for the appropriate mapping to trigger with the help of a decision
   table included in the jar itself (cfr resources/TABLES), as described in the
   documentation.
 * The mapping is driven by meta-data under the form of a DEF file, also contained
   in the jar itself (cfr resources/DEF). See documentation, and online tutorials.
 * The reverseXSL Transformer can also automate XSL-based mappings from XML to XML, 
   or from XML to anything. Such XSL transformation can be executed alone, else as
   a post-transformation next to parsing. However, XSL transformation steps
   are ignored by the free software version. They are therefore not illustrated
   by the supplied sample message transformations.


2. LICENSE REGISTRATION:

	This software is licensed under the Apache 2.0 Open Source license available at: http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php 	

3. KNOWN ISSUES:

	Customary licenses make use of the java preferences backing store system for
	saving a copy of registration data. You can re-register with the help of the
	Licensing program described above, at any time, and repeatedly, without harm.
	
	On UNIX/LINUX the JVM persists the backing store in a file. Permission issues
	may yield the following problem:
	
	   WARNING: Couldn't flush system prefs: java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException [...]
	
	for which remedies are documented within the FAQ list cited here below.
