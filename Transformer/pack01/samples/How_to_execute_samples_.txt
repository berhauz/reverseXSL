
1. extract the contents of /samples sub-directories to a directory of your choice
	that also contains the reverseXSL.jar (the sub-directory levels disappear)
   You shall get:
	TypeB_FWB_01.txt
	MT101_01.txt
	VATdeclaration.csv
	  VATdeclare.xls
	  MakeDeclaration.bat
	reverseXSL.jar 

   all in the same directory. The .xls and .bat are not sample messages in proper; they 
   illustrate a simple use within an Excel Macro.

2. get a command shell (e.g. on MS-Windows Start>Run...Open: "cmd" >OK)

   Please ensure that the default directory of the command shell corresponds to the one
   inside which you extracted the files and also have the original reverseXSL.jar.

   then type:

	java -version

   which shall return your default java virtual machine (JVM) version:
   Check that that you have installed a JVM of version 1.4 or later and that
   it is available on the command PATH
   
3. run the transformations

	java -jar reverseXSL.jar TypeB_FWB_01.txt

	java -jar reverseXSL.jar MT101_01.txt

	java -jar reverseXSL.jar VATdeclaration.csv

4. additional tips:

	to capture the generated XML document, type for instance:
		java -jar reverseXSL.jar TypeB_FWB_01.txt >myOutput.xml

	You can execute the VAT declaration sample by opening the Excel workbook and clicking
	on the export button. The button triggers a VBA Macro that invokes MakeDeclaration.bat.
	But without a license, the XSL template (MapToInterVAT.xsl) in resources/XSL will not be
	executed on the fly and the final result will not comply with the target 
	schema reference/DeclarationTVA-1.5.xsd; yet, you will get the XML document generated 
	by the Parsing step alone with a reminder in traces that the free version 
	ignores XSL Transformation steps.
