</head>

<p>
	The reverseXSL software provides two interfaces:
<ul>
	<li>The command line interface is described in this one package.</li>
	<li>The API, comprising the {@link com.reverseXSL.transform.Transformer}, 
		{@link com.reverseXSL.transform.TransformerFactory}, and lower-level 
		{@link com.reverseXSL.parser.Parser} objects; cfr these other
	packages.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
	This specific package contains three command line tools that, exception made
	of course of the License Management application, will be mostly used to automate
	testing within the development cycle.
</p>
	<p>Command line tools are wrappers built over the original API. Source code is made available for building 
	your custom command line programs, as well as sample API code.</p>
	<p>Development tips are contained within the documentation published on reverseXSL.com.</p>
<p>Another command line tool worth noting is the Regular Expression {@link com.reverseXSL.util.RegexCheck tester}. This one is located within
the package com.reverseXSL.util. It is very handy for quickly checking the outcome of your regular expressions on single line and multiline data.</p>
